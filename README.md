# To reproduce 2-photon FLIM data, the cell-analysis-tools repository (https://github.com/skalalab/cell-analysis-tools) can be used with the included binary masks. Raw fluorescence decays and exponential fits are included in the data folders.
# To reproduce scatter plots/heatmaps, the included Excel files can be used.
# To reproduce histograms, seaborn = 0.12.0 (histoplot) is required.
# To generate widefield ORR, the ImageJ script can be run on each individual folder, which includes a matched NAD(P)H and FAD intensity tiff
